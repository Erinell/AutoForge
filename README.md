# AutoForge

AutoForge is a Python tool for generating 3D printed layered models from an input image. Using a learned optimization strategy with a Gumbel softmax formulation, AutoForge assigns materials per layer and produces both a discretized composite image and a 3D-printable STL file. It also generates swap instructions to guide the printer through material changes during a multi-material print.

## Features

- **Image-to-Model Conversion**: Converts an input image into a layered model suitable for 3D printing.
- **Learned Optimization**: Optimizes per-pixel height and per-layer material assignments using JAX and Optax.
- **Gumbel Softmax Sampling**: Leverages the Gumbel softmax method to decide material assignments for each layer.
- **STL File Generation**: Exports an ASCII STL file based on the optimized height map.
- **Swap Instructions**: Generates clear swap instructions for changing materials during printing.
- **Live Visualization**: (Optional) Displays live composite images during the optimization process.

## Example

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hvoss-techfak/AutoForge.git
   cd AutoForge
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

See the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file for a complete list of dependencies.  
The optimizer is built using JAX, which benefits from a CUDA-compatible GPU for optimal performance.  
Without a dedicated GPU the process can take significantly longer (up to 10x slower).  
If you have a GPU, you can install the GPU version of JAX by running:

```bash
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"
```

## Usage

The script is run from the command line and accepts several arguments. Below is an example command:

> **Note:** You will need [Hueforge](https://shop.thehueforge.com/) installed to export your filament CSV.  
> To get your CSV file, simply go to the "Filaments" menu in Hueforge, click the export button, select your filaments, and export them as a CSV file.

```bash
python auto_forge.py \
  --input_image path/to/input_image.jpg \
  --csv_file path/to/materials.csv \
  --output_folder outputs \
  --iterations 20000 \
  --learning_rate 0.01 \
  --layer_height 0.04 \
  --max_layers 50 \
  --background_height 0.4 \
  --background_color "#8e9089" \
  --max_size 512 \
  --decay 0.01 \
  --loss mse \
  --visualize
```

Currently, the height mesh output is in ascii stl format, which Hueforge does not support. We will fix thie export in an upcoming version. \
To convert the ascii stl to binary stl, simply import it into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (or the 3d program of your choice) and export it as a stl again.

Another current bug is a slight color discrepancy between our output and hueforge. \
If anyone has an idea what the problem is, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request :)

### Command Line Arguments

- `--config`: *(Optional)* Path to a configuration file with the settings.
- `--input_image`: **(Required)** Path to the input image.
- `--csv_file`: **(Required)** Path to the CSV file containing material data. The CSV should include columns for the brand, name, color (hex code), and TD values.
- `--output_folder`: **(Required)** Folder where output files will be saved.
- `--iterations`: Number of optimization iterations (default: 20000).
- `--learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer (default: 5e-3).
- `--layer_height`: Layer thickness in millimeters (default: 0.04).
- `--max_layers`: Maximum number of layers (default: 75). 
  **Note:** This is about 3mm + the background height
- `--background_height`: Height of the background in millimeters (default: 0.4).  
  **Note:** The background height must be divisible by the layer height.
- `--background_color`: Background color in hexadecimal format (default: `#8e9089` aka Bambulab Grey).
- `--max_size`: Maximum dimension (width or height) for the resized target image (default: 512).
- `--decay`: Final tau value for the Gumbel-Softmax formulation (default: 0.01).
- `--loss`: Loss function to use. Choices are `mse`, `perceptual`, or `perceptual_l1` (default: `mse`).
- `--visualize`: Flag to enable live visualization of the composite image during optimization.

## Outputs

After running, the following files will be created in your specified output folder:

- **Discrete Composite Image**: `discrete_comp.png`
- **STL File**: `final_model.stl`
- **Swap Instructions**: `swap_instructions.txt`

Just a heads-up, this program is mainly concerned with realistic output and will give you VERY long swap instructions.
Expect to switch your filament every 1-2 layers!

For more artistic control or to reduce the number of swaps, consider buying [Hueforge](https://shop.thehueforge.com/).
